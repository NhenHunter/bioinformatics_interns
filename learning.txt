Hello fabulous, genius intern!!
Happy halloween,
	I hope you have been having a fabulous day. Did you dress up?


	If yes, what are you?



	Why did you choose this costume?


How incredible. Halloween is a great holiday for self expression, as you may be whoever you dream of being while making it your own version!

	Does any one have a plan for trick or treating? 


Speaking of which, why is it called that? Will I trick if I  dont get a treat? Has anyone truly TP'd a house that was not giving out candy? I just need to know honestly.
The line above looks a bit awkward, is it on the same line feed? Can you put it on the same linefeed if not?

I hope we have a great evening today and that you are all able to take home a lot of info! Tis my great honor to teach and fill your minds, as you all teach me as well.
Can you remove that space there? I feel as though the "t" should be in line with the "I". Thanks! Enjoy vim!
































































BOO!
