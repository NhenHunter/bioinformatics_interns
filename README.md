# bioinformatics_interns
#This project is through the AMNH BridgeUp:STEM program. The goal of the project is to introduce new topics and bioinformatic concepts to high school interns of the museum.
#The project's main goal is to create two functions.
#One function will write nucleotides to a file, creating a fasta file. The sequence will be highly repetitive and these particular repeats will be found throughout the sequence.
#The next function will be a motif finder. The motif finder will parse through a fasta or fastq file to detect and record information about repeats in the sequence.
